# StandingTheTestOfTime

This is a sample project which illustrates the concept of using a Date Provider object based a presentation I gave in April 2017 at the Tokyo iOS Meetup. This project illustrates how a Date Provider object can be injected as a dependency for testing logic that depends on the current date & time.
